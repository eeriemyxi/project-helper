# Project Helper

This project gives you an organized way to start and manage your creative ideas.

## Features

Change current working directory by index.

```
...\Example >>> showdir
0 | 0.0 MB | DIR > hello-world-project
1 | 0.0 MB | FILE > index.js
2 | 0.0 MB | FILE > main.py
3 | 0.0 MB | DIR > my-github-readme
...\Example >>> cd .0
...\Example\hello-world-project >>> cd..
...\Example >>> cd .3
...\Example\my-github-readme >>>
```
- I'm planning to add custom cd keywords soon.

## Commands

I've added around 16 commands. 
You can type `help` to get to know them.

It's very easy to add your own commands.
You can check the files in `commands/command_functions`.

## Bugs
I'm pretty sure there are a lot of bugs, please let me know if you find any.
